Gender and face recognition is an important tool for security sector, recognizing in a low-resolution security camera or a car dash cam is an issue a police officer would like to solve. Using a machine learning model that will classify the gender and age of a person that passes by the camera is one solution. Hence, a decision to design a machine learning model that has high accuracy in detecting humans age and gender has been made. Using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trials on different case studies aiming to get an optimum result has been done. However, in the process the effects of the parameters in the model are clear, hoping for better
results in future work.
